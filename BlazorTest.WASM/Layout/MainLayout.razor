@namespace BlazorTest
@inherits LzLayoutComponentBaseInjectViewModel<ISessionsViewModel>
@*
    This component instantiates the ISessionsViewModel singleton.
    However, Maui Hybrid and WASM apps do not setup the DI context exactly the same way.
    In MAUI, it is necessary to pass the JSRuntime into classes that are not UI components.
    This is done in the Init.razor page. Once this is done, the SessionsViewModel.IsInitialized
    property is set to true.

    Any child components, like NavMenu below, must be aware of the SessionsViewModel
    initialization lifecycle and operate property before and after initialization.

<div class="page">

    @if (ViewModel!.IsInitialized)
    {
        <div class="sidebar">
            <NavMenu ViewModel="@ViewModel" />
        </div>
    }
    <main>
        <article class="content px-4">
            @Body
        </article>

</div>
